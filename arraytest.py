# Brainery:(All these may be powered by skycity or brain energy of food or light 
    # (A Chip in the brain Which runs using your energy by food) ( All of the certain actions may need to start to work only when a specific type of thought or word is thought or said rspctvly.)

        # Communicate to each other just by thinking((thoughts will be sent as thoughts at lightning speed )automatic comprehension by the thinking algorithm to others, no need to translate the language or say the words in mind) or (create a tech that converts brain impulses to words and vice verca)
